##### Hooks

Hooks:

- were introduced in React 16.8 as a new feature
- allow the creation of components based on functions with the functionality of a class-based component (handle & update state, the use of context for communications between components, simulate lifecycle methods)

* The use of hooks reduces the code base extension
* Using hooks reduces complexity
* Logic separation gets easier with hooks
