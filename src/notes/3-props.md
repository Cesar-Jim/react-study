##### Props

Props:

- are used to pass information between components
- are basically kind of a global variable or object
- are variables passed to a React Component by its parent component
- essentially they are always passed down the component tree
- are the React Function Component's parameters
- are passed as HTML attributes to the component
- are always coming as object
- are IMMUTABLE

* The props object is available as argument in the function signature
* Use destructuring to extract the information from the props
* When using arrow functions for React components, nothing changes for the props
